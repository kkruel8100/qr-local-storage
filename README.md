# QR Code LocalStorage Project

This project contains a simple HTML page (`store.html`) that accepts a key/value pair in the URL
and saves it to localStorage with a timestamp.

## Usage

1. Host `store.html` on any server (local or GitHub Pages).
2. Access the page using URLs like:

```
store.html?key=mode&value=dark
```

3. Scan the QR codes included in this folder to test.

## Sample QR Codes

- `mode_dark.png` → key=mode, value=dark
- `setting_on.png` → key=setting, value=on
- `volume_high.png` → key=volume, value=high
